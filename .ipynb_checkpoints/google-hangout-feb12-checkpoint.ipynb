    "No, we only need the json containing the solution. create_submission.py script can help create the solution json file. While most of you will be trying programmatic approaches, it is perfectly fine to use crowdsourcing or BRAT tool to annotate the data too.\n",

    "Q2: What should the output file contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be a json file containing a list of json elements, where each element corresponds to 1 sentence in the dataset.json input file. For each sentence, you have to provide a rewritten sentence (text), imputed entity (the one you used to replace XXXX), and the type(s) of the entity. Please use the create_submission.py to generate this."

SunTrust even advertised that they would not put a cap on a cardholder 's ability to earn miles. \n",

I know of at least XXXX cases where SunTrust contacted XXXX XXXX to have the miles in the cardholder 's account reversed!!! \n",

This is unacceptable and a regulatory violation. \n",
